## Background

I play a lot of board games with a lot of different people. Sometimes I want to bring games that I have that I think would be fun with a certain group, but I don't want to constantly cross reference and check their collection to see if they have that game or not.

## Motivation

I hadn't worked with XML before and since BoardGameGeek's (BGG) API utilizes XML format, I thought it was the perfect time to experiment with it. I created this web app to:

1. Check my collection in a well-formatted display
2. Check what games I had that my friends didn't
